== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I add my MLS boards listings to my website? =
Go to [https://wovax.com/products/idx/](https://wovax.com/products/idx/ "Wovax IDX WordPress Plugin") and sign up for Wovax IDX. Typically there is a paperwork process with your MLS board to obtain access to the live data feed. A Wovax representative will guide you through that process, then live real estate listings will be added to your site.

= What is a RETS feed? =
RETS stands for ‚ÄúReal Estate Transaction Standard.‚Äù A RETS feed is a raw data feed that and IDX provider translates into readable information on your website. Most MLS boards provide MLS data in the RETS format, and Wovax will work with any RETS feed. Feel free to reach out with questions about your particular MLS board‚Äôs rules, requirements, and/or fees.

= What does IDX stand for? =
IDX stands for Internet Data Exchange. This is the process of translating raw data into a visual real estate listing search on your website.

Yes. You can write your own custom variations of the existing/bundled CSS of Wovax IDX, or you can dequeue the Wovax IDX CSS and include your own custom CSS in your WordPress theme.

= Do you provide IDX to my local MLS board? =
Please [contact us here](https://wovax.com/support/ "Wovax Support") to request information about your MLS board.

= Is this an iframe? =
No, Wovax IDX integrates MLS property listings directly into your site via the Wovax JSON API in real time. Rather than embedding the listings into a frame, we integrate each property into your website.
